# NVIDIA App MCP Connection

## Transport overview

NVIDIA App exposes one persistent MCP server from its NvContainer-hosted plugin and supports two client transports:

- Streamable HTTP over loopback.
- A stdio bridge executable that relays MCP messages to the server's per-user named pipe.

The stdio executable is a relay, not a standalone server. If NVIDIA App's MCP master toggle is disabled, launching the bridge does not enable or start the persistent server.

## Agent-side configuration

When a connection is needed and `NVIDIA-App` is not already registered with the current MCP client, add it to that client using an available MCP-management capability or the client's documented configuration mechanism. Do not stop at showing configuration JSON when the agent can apply it directly. Prefer registration even when the loopback endpoint already answers, because a registered entry persists and exposes the tools to later turns and sessions.

- Inspect the existing client configuration first; reuse a valid `NVIDIA-App` entry and do not create a duplicate.
- Register with the Streamable HTTP connection described below. Use the stdio bridge only when HTTP is unavailable or the current client requires or manages a local relay process. Obtain any required approval before changing client configuration, and never expose or persist authentication material outside the protected client configuration.
- After adding or reloading the entry, call `tools/list` to verify the connection and tool discovery.
- If the agent cannot modify or reload its own MCP configuration, provide the exact configuration and state the specific action the user must perform. Do not guess an unverified configuration location or format.

### Direct-connection fallback

Connect directly to the endpoints below, without a client entry, when any of these holds:

- The user declines or defers the client configuration change.
- The client offers no way for the agent to add or reload an MCP entry.
- The entry was written, but `nvapp_` tools are still absent from the current session and the user does not want to restart or reload.

In that case, complete the user's request over Streamable HTTP (or the stdio bridge) using the same documented tools, schemas, and restrictions. Name the fallback in your reply and note that registering `NVIDIA-App` avoids repeating it. Read `server.json` fresh on each auth-enabled connection and keep the token out of transcripts, logs, and command lines.

- If connection or tool discovery still fails after the applicable configuration and reload attempts, instruct the user to verify that NVIDIA App is installed, that it is the latest available version (11.0.9.5xx or above), and that MCP server access is enabled in NVIDIA App Settings before retrying.

## HTTP connection

The compiled defaults are:

```text
Host:     127.0.0.1
Port:     13508
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:13508/mcp
```

Typical client configuration when session authentication is disabled:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "NVIDIA-App": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:13508/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server registers `/mcp/` with http.sys and reports its client URL without the trailing slash.

### Port fallback

If registration of port `13508` fails for a reason other than `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, the server falls back in two tiers. It first tries the adjacent range next to the default, then the ephemeral range:

```text
Tier 1 (adjacent):  13509, 13510, 13511, 13512, 13513,
                    13514, 13515, 13516, 13517, 13518
Tier 2 (ephemeral): 49152, 49153, 49154, 49155, 49156,
                    49157, 49158, 49159, 49160, 49161
```

When an auth-enabled discovery file exists, use its `http` value rather than assuming port `13508`. When no discovery file exists, an MCP client cannot generically discover a fallback port from disk; use the default endpoint, the NVIDIA App-reported `http_url`, or the stdio bridge.

If http.sys returns `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, the backend does not try the fallback range. NVIDIA App continues in pipe-only degraded mode when the named-pipe server is available.

## Discovery and token file

Auth-enabled builds write this plain JSON file at server startup:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA Corporation\NvAppMcpServer\server.json
```

Example shape:

```json
{
  "pipe": "<per-user named-pipe name>",
  "http": "http://127.0.0.1:13508/mcp/",
  "token": "<fresh 256-bit session token>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "pid": 12345
}
```

The `http` property is omitted when HTTP failed to start. The file is protected for the creating user, the token is regenerated at server startup, and the file is removed when the plugin uninitializes.

Read the file fresh after every server restart. Never print, log, persist elsewhere, or place the token in ordinary tool arguments.

## Authenticated HTTP example

Use the `http` and `token` values read from the same fresh `server.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "NVIDIA-App": {
      "url": "{http-from-server.json}",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {token-from-server.json}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Do not copy the placeholder literally and do not commit a real token.

## Stdio connection

Installed bridge path:

```text
%ProgramFiles%\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA App\McpServer\NvAppMcpServer.exe
```

Typical configuration when session authentication is disabled:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "NVIDIA-App": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\NVIDIA App\\McpServer\\NvAppMcpServer.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

For an auth-enabled build, provide the fresh token through the bridge environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "NVIDIA-App": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\NVIDIA App\\McpServer\\NvAppMcpServer.exe",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "NVAPP_MCP_TOKEN": "{token-from-server.json}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The bridge resolves the current user's named-pipe name, connects with retry, and relays binary-safe stdio. If the pipe is unavailable and the MCP readiness event is not signaled, it reports `service_disabled` with guidance to enable MCP server access in NVIDIA App Settings.

## MCP protocol lifecycle

The server accepts two protocol eras:

- Modern `2026-07-28`: stateless HTTP requests; it does not emit `Mcp-Session-Id` or use standalone session-stream or session-close requests.
- Legacy `2025-11-25` and earlier supported versions (`2024-11-05`, `2025-03-26`): initialize creates a session, the response carries `Mcp-Session-Id`, subsequent requests echo it, and the client manages the notification stream and session closure.

Ordinary MCP clients should manage this lifecycle. Do not manually add legacy session headers to a modern connection.

## Readiness sequence

Connection success and Overlay success are separate:

1. NVIDIA App's MCP master toggle allows the persistent NvContainer plugin to run.
2. The named-pipe and, when available, HTTP transports start.
3. The MCP server readiness event is signaled.
4. NVIDIA In-Game Overlay independently signals its own readiness event.

The restricted Overlay tools in this skill can return `overlay_not_available` even after the MCP connection succeeds. Non-Overlay NVIDIA App tools do not depend on Overlay readiness.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `server.json` is missing but default HTTP works | Session authentication is disabled | Continue without a token. |
| `server.json` is missing and neither transport connects | MCP master toggle is off or the server did not start | Ask the user to enable MCP server access in NVIDIA App Settings. |
| Port `13508` refuses connection | HTTP used a fallback port, HTTP startup failed, or the server is disabled | Use the discovery/runtime URL when available or use stdio. |
| Discovery file lacks `http` | HTTP failed and the server is in pipe-only mode | Use the stdio bridge. |
| Auth-enabled connection has read-only access | Token is missing, invalid, or stale | Reread `server.json` and reconfigure the token without exposing it. |
| Stdio returns `service_disabled` | Persistent server readiness event is not signaled | Enable MCP server access; do not repeatedly spawn bridge processes. |
| MCP connects but Overlay calls return `overlay_not_available` | In-Game Overlay is disabled or not running | Enable NVIDIA App Settings > Features > In-Game Overlay, then retry. |
